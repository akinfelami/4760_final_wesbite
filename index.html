    <h1>MacroData Refinement on Pico</h1>
    <h3>ECE 4760 Final Report</h3>
    <h3>Akinfolami Akin-Alamu (aoa9) &amp; Wilson Coronel (wrc62)</h3>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <!-- <p>Sound Bite: We demonstrate a ChatGPT user interface for music generation with a
        keypad connected to an RP2040.</p>

    <p>Summary: In this
        project, we successfully built an audio synthesizer that plays musical melodies of various lengths and
        styles generated by ChatGPT. The user has control over the key the melody is in via presses of a keypad, as
        well as control over the length and style of the generated melody through simple edits to the prompt. Our
        implementation consists of a python file that uses the ChatGPT API to produce the melodies (run on the host
        computer), and a C file that runs on the RP2040 and communicates with the python file by sending the key
        pressed to the host and receives the melody from the host. </span></p> -->
    <h2>High level design</h2>
    <p>The primary inspiration for this
        project was the television series Severance. A central element of the show is Lumon
        Industries' Macro Data Refinement department, where "severed" employees sort groups of numbers based on the
        emotions
        (Woe, Frolic, Dread, and Malice) these numbers evoke. The "terminal-looking" interface provided a compelling
        basis for
        an interactive game. We also drew inspiration from the fan-made web version of the game available at
        lumon-industries.com, aiming to create a hardware-based counterpart. The project's goal was to not only
        replicate the
        game mechanics but also to weave in "easter eggs" and the general aesthetic of the show.</p>
    <p>We utilized fixed-point
        arithmetic for efficient computation, particularly within the boid animation and game logic
        updates. We used 16.15 fixed-point numbers for calculations involving boid positions, velocities, and
        behavioral
        parameters. This allowed us to cram heavy floating point computations into the game logic and still meet
        frame rate
        deadlines without sacrificing smooth animations. Additionally, besides computing positions of pixels on the
        screen, much
        of the math in this game came from the movement of the invisible "boids" that cause numbers to quiver. This
        movement is
        governed by a flocking algorithm which causes each boid to adjust its velocity based on factors such as:
        cohesion
        (moving towards the average position of nearby boids), separation (avoiding really close by boids) and wall
        avoidance
        (turn away from screen boundaries). More parameters such as VISUAL_RANGE, PROTECTED_RANGE control the
        specifics of these
        behaviors and distance calculations were approximated using the "Alpha max plus beta min" method.
    </p>
    <p>The game operates using a state machine and concurrent processing handled by
        protothreads.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Game States:</strong> The game progresses through three states defined by the
            <code>PlayState</code> enum:
            The game begins in the <code>START_SCREEN</code> state, which displays an initial message prompting the user
            to
            start. During the <code>PLAYING</code> state, which is the main interactive phase, the refinement process
            takes
            place. Finally, when all refining is complete, the game transitions to the <code>GAME_WON</code> state where
            it
            displays the completion screen.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Main loop:</strong> Within the <code>PLAYING</code> state, the system continuously.
            It updates boid positions and velocities, checks for collisions between boids and the
            number grid (which triggers animations), and scans for user input through the joystick for cursor movement
            and
            button for refinement. When refinement is triggered on a "bad number", the game state is updated by removing
            refined numbers and regenerating new ones, bin animations are triggered, and the overall progress bar is
            updated. Finally, all visual elements are redrawn on the VGA screen.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Protothreads:</strong> Concurrency is managed using the
            <code>pt_cornell_rp2040_v1_3.h</code> library.
            On Core 0, we have three protothreads: protothread_graphics which handles drawing the main game screen,
            protothread_joystick which reads ADC values from the joystick and updates cursor position, and
            protothread_button_press which debounces the refinement button and triggers refinement logic. Core 1 runs
            two
            protothreads: protothread_graphics_too which manages the animations of the Woe, Frolic, Dread, and Malice
            bins,
            and protothread_progress_bar which updates the state of the main progress bar animation.
        </li>

    </ul>
    <p>
        All the game code is written in C. We utilized the provided <a
            href="https://github.com/vha3/Hunter-Adams-RP2040-Demos/tree/master/VGA_Graphics">vga library</a> which gave
        us a great head start. An Analog
        joystick (purchased from Amazon) was chosen for user interaction. The proposal initially considered eight
        buttons, but a
        joystick for cursor movement was found to be more intuitive for navigating the grid.

        implementation.</p>
    <h2>Program/Hardware design</h2>
    <h3>Hardware Design</h3>
    <p>For the hardware of the joystick, we connected it to the program using the Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)
        feature
        on the Raspberry Pi. This was implemented in a single protothread called Protothread_joystick. We reserved GPIO
        pins
        27 and 28 to function as the Voltage-Read-X-coordinate (VRX) and Voltage-Read-Y-coordinate (VRY), respectively.
        To
        implement the joystick correctly, we must first understand how this specific joystick works.
    </p>
    <p>
        Moving the joystick left or right changes the voltage of the VRX whereas up and down changes the voltage of VRY.
        This movement relays the analog voltage level to the RP2040 to which it then converts to a binary signal. In
        order
        to provide voltage in the first place, we connect the joystick to GPIO pin 36, which functions as an output of
        3.3
        Volts.
    </p>
    <p>
        When turned left, the voltage level is 0 (shorted to ground), corresponding to a binary value of 0. Similarly,
        when
        turned right, the voltage level is 3.3 volts and that corresponds to a binary value of 8023. Generally in
        joystick
        architecture that is found in any controller, there is a threshold for which when the ADC value crosses, it
        counts
        as a read for turning left or right, For example, our int value X_RIGHT_THRESHOLD is set to 3000, for when the
        returned ADC value is greater than this number the program knows to count that as a right. This is also done for
        left, up and down.
    </p>
    <p>
        Our first attempt to implement the joystick came with a small obstacle. We generally use the ADC to poll
        something
        such as a potentiometer, which provides a single voltage output into the RP2040. However, we are now trying to
        read
        two values, that being VRX and VRY. At first, we implemented an in-built feature of the ADC known as
        adc_set_round_robin. Which uses a queue in order to have a First-in-First-out data structure. The ADC reads one
        input, puts it in the queue, and then polls the next input into the queue. However, we noticed that it randomly
        picked an input to start the queue, which made it difficult to program other functions that rely on knowing if
        VRX
        or VRY is going to pop from the queue. Also, with the round robin method it provided a lot of memory overhead,
        something we were trying to avoid.
    </p>
    <p>
        This then led to us having helper functions that when called, switched the input to be read to either VRX or
        VRY.
        While this does increase our running time a bit, it was the best option as we favored memory over speed.
    </p>
    <p>
        The ADC feature polls the voltage level of the joystick far too frequently for any realistic human interaction.
        In
        order to circumvent this, we added a timer that polls the protothread every 70 ms. We got to this number by user
        testing random numbers and saw which timer gave us the most smooth interaction.
    </p>
    <p>
        Included in the joystick is a button that can be pressed. This means we need debouncing and implies that there
        should be a separate protothread. This is done because debouncing relies on quick execution of a state machine
        that
        tells us if it reads a button press because a person is pressing the button or contact between mechanical
        switches
        that can happen arbitrarily. We need to read this at a higher frequency than that of the joystick. So we
        schedule
        the protothread for the button to run every 30 ms as opposed to the 70 ms the joystick protothread runs on.
    </p>
    <p>
        To support the VGA display, specific GPIO pins on the RP2040 are connected to the VGA port: GPIO 16 is used for
        horizontal sync (Hsync), and GPIO 17 for vertical sync (Vsync). Color signals are sent through GPIO 18 and 19
        for
        green (via 470 Ω and 330 Ω resistors, respectively), GPIO 20 for blue (330 Ω), and GPIO 21 for red (330 Ω). The
        ground of the RP2040 is connected to VGA ground. The DMA channel, paced by the DREQ_PIO0_TX2 data request
        signal,
        feeds pixel data to the RGB PIO state machine. Each byte sent corresponds to a character in the global
        vga_data_array, representing two adjacent pixels. We use 4 bits per pixel: 1 bit each for red and blue, and 2
        bits
        for green, taking advantage of the eye’s greater sensitivity to green. As mentioned before, we used the vga
        library
        provided by Hunter Adams.
    </p>
    <!-- <p>The Program to Hardware connections are as follows: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>the Host (Computer I/O) waits for a keypad input from the
            keypad to be processed in the RP2040.</li>
        <li>the RP2040 processes the keypad input and assigns a musical key
            to each keypad key (here there are two definitions of the word &ldquo;key&rdquo;)&mdash; 2 corresponds
            to A major, 3 to B major, 4 to C major, etc.</li>
        <li>Depending on which key is pressed, the RP2040 sends a message
            to the host through UART which then gets sent to ChatGPT as a prompt.</li>
        <li>After creating a 10 note melody in the designated key, the host
            sends back a serial signal to the RP2040 .</li>
        <li>The RP2040 then processes this array as in the format of a 20
            length array of [frequencies, durations].</li>
        <li>The RP2040 then plays the 10 notes through the PWM and outputs
            on the speakers.</li>
    </ul>

    </div>
    <p>In Figures 1 and 2, we can see the hardware implementation including the keypad on the
        bottom left where we send input signals to the DAC. It is almost identical in setup to the Bird Sound
        Synthesis lab &ndash; it is connected to the RP2040 which is located on the right and connected to the lab
        computer as well as the serial jack (seen in the blue), and the audio jack which feeds into a speaker via a
        3.5mm audio socket that outputs generated beeps. The DAC is connected (to send SPI signals) to the Pico by
        connecting each of the ports following the DAC datasheet and the #define statements in the source code.
    </p>
    <p>The DAC pins are VDD, chip select, the clock line, SDI (same as MOSI), VoutA (one of
        the outputs), VSS is ground, VOUTB (the other output) and the LDAC pin. The LDAC pin allowed us to
        separately load the left and right channels for the DAC and then, when that pin is toggled, both are sent to
        the output simultaneously.</p>
    <p>A similar procedure was done for the 3.5mm audio
        socket, which had two pin configurations, not including its GND of course. </p>

    <h3>Overall Architecture</h3>
    <p>
        The system leverages both cores of the RP2040. Core 0 is responsible for the main graphics rendering
        (<code>protothread_graphics</code>), joystick input (<code>protothread_joystick</code>), and the refinement
        button logic
        (<code>protothread_button_press</code>). Core 1 handles animations: the bottom bins' grow/shrink effect
        (<code>protothread_graphics_too</code>)
        and the progress bar fill animation logic (<code>protothread_progress_bar</code>). This division distributes the
        workload,
        allowing
        for smoother animations and responsive input. Communication between threads, such as signaling the start of the
        game, is
        managed using semaphores (<code>start_game_sem</code>).
    </p>
    <h3>Game State Management</h3>
    <p>The central data structure is <code>GameState</code>, defined in <code>game_state.h</code>. It
        covers all dynamic aspects of the game:</p>
    <p>The game state consists of several key components: <code>state[ROWS][COLS]</code> is a 2D array of Number structs
        representing the grid of numbers, where each Number stores its value, position, size, animation flags
        (animated_last_frame_by_boid0/1, refined_last_frame), and whether it's a "bad number" (is_bad_number) along with
        its associated BadNumber data (target bin_id). <code>boids[NUM_BOIDS]</code> is an array of Boid structs,
        storing their position (x, y), velocity (vx, vy), bias, and scout group. <code>box_anims[5]</code> is an array
        of BoxAnim structs that manages the state of the animated bins at the bottom, including their current animation
        height, state (ANIM_IDLE, ANIM_GROWING, ANIM_SHRINKING), and the percentage of each "emotion" (Woe, Frolic,
        Dread, Malice) they contain. The <code>cursor</code> is a Cursor struct storing the position and dimensions of
        the player-controlled cursor. <code>play_state</code> is an enum PlayState indicating the current phase of the
        game (e.g., START_SCREEN, PLAYING). <code>total_bad_numbers</code> tracks the count of unrefined "bad numbers" -
        when there are zero left, the game is won! Finally, <code>progress_bar</code> is a ProgressBarAnimation struct
        for managing the top progress bar's visual state.</p>

    <p>Initialization is handled by <code>game_state_init()</code>, which populates the number grid with random values,
        assigns some
        as "bad
        numbers" with random target bins, and spawns the boids. Spawning boids involves initializing all boids'
        position,
        velocity, and bias characteristics. Then, for each frame, we calculate new velocities and positions for each
        boid based
        on interactions with other boids and screen boundaries. Additionally, we check if a boid is within
        <code>BOID_COLLISION_RADIUS</code>
        of any number cell. If so, the <code>animate_numbers()</code> function is called, causing the number to slightly
        shift its
        position
        (quiver) based on a random pixel shift. If the number is a "bad number", its display size is increased. Flags
        (<code>animated_last_frame_by_boid0</code> or <code>animated_last_frame_by_boid1</code>) are set on the Number
        struct to indicate it has
        been
        "touched" by a boid. This is crucial for the refinement logic.
    </p>

    <h3>Number Grid and Refinement Logic</h3>
    <p>The game screen features a grid of numbers (<code>ROWS</code> x <code>COLS</code>). Numbers are initially random
        digits (0-9). A small
        percentage
        are flagged as <code>is_bad_number</code> and assigned a random <code>bin_id</code> (0-3) corresponding to one
        of the four emotion bins.
        When the
        player moves the cursor over a number and presses the refinement button, <code>handle_cursor_refinement()</code>
        function is
        invoked.
        This function identifies the number that is currently selected, using the current
        (<code>x</code>,<code>y</code>) position of the cursor.
        Then it
        checks if it is a bad number AND if it has been animated in the current frame. This is important so that we
        don't refine
        bad numbers that are not quivering in this frame. So if these conditions are met, the refined number and ALL the
        numbers
        that are animated by that same boid are marked as <code>refined_last_frame</code>. This is why we have a flag
        for each boid
        indicating it has animated some numbers. For example, when <code>boid0</code> comes in contact with some
        numbers, it marks
        them as
        <code>animated_last_frame_by_boid0</code>. This means that when we find that a bad_number is animated by the
        <code>boid0</code>, only
        numbers
        <code>animated_last_frame_by_boid0</code> are refined.
    </p>
    <p>Following, the identification of the numbers to be refined, <code>total_bad_numbers</code> is decremented, the
        corresponding
        bin
        animation (<code>state->box_anims[bin_id].anim_state = ANIM_GROWING;</code>) and the main progress bar animation
        are
        triggered.
        Finally, in the next main graphics cycle, numbers marked <code>refined_last_frame</code> are regenerated with
        new random
        values,
        potentially becoming new "bad numbers."</p>

    <p>A tricky part was coordinating the boid animation flags with the refinement logic to ensure only "quivering" bad
        numbers
        could be refined. It involved maintaining many layers of state between different parts of the game. The
        interaction
        where refining one number in a boid-activated cluster also "refines" the others in that cluster was an explicit
        design
        choice to simulate sorting a "group" of numbers as described in the show.</p>

    <h3>Graphics</h3>
    <p>Drawing is performed using the <code>vga16_graphics.h</code> library, which provides primitives for pixels,
        lines, rectangles,
        circles, and text. Our initial plan was to use a custom font. But we weren't able to find an open source font
        bitmap
        that correctly matched the given vga graphics library. We mostly used the provided functions like
        <code>drawPixel</code>,
        <code>drawLine</code>, <code>drawRect</code>, <code>fillRect</code>, <code>drawChar</code>,
        <code>setCursor</code>,
        <code>setTextColor</code>, <code>setTextSize</code> and <code>writeString</code>. We also implemented a
        <code>drawOval(short x0, short y0, short rx, short ry, char color)</code> method. This function uses the
        midpoint ellipse algorithm to draw
        ovals, which was essential for rendering the Lumon logo.
    </p>

    <p>The number quivering/sizing was by modifying <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, <code>size</code> in the
        <code>Number</code> struct within <code>animate_numbers()</code> and
        redrawing in
        <code>protothread_graphics</code>. We made sure to cap the max pixel shift by the size of the current number
        grid. On the
        other hand,
        the <code>BoxAnim</code> struct's <code>current_anim_height</code> is incremented/decremented during
        <code>ANIM_GROWING</code>/<code>ANIM_SHRINKING</code> states,
        and
        <code>drawRect</code> is used to visualize this. The animation pauses for 3 seconds when fully grown to display
        percentages.
        This
        animation happens over more than one frame. Essentially, when the state is <code>ANIM_GROWING</code>, we
        progressively erase
        and draw
        the box taller than the last frame until it reaches a specific height after which we transition to
        <code>ANIM_SHRINKING</code>. In
        the next frame, the reverse of the process for growing the box happens.

    <h2>Results of the design</h2>
    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>The primary goal of this project was to replicate the sorting process featured in the TV show Severance, with a
        strong emphasis on usability. Our objective was to make the game fully playable and closely aligned with its
        on-screen counterpart, ensuring that fans of the show could engage with it and feel as though they were
        experiencing
        the original game firsthand.
        We ended up with a result that satisfies the above. With the in game mechanics and scoring system based off the
        game, we were able to replicate it to a close degree of accuracy. We emphasized minor details such as the Lumon
        Logo
        on the upper right hand corner, and the visuals that happen when a point is won.
        Due to multiple things happening at the same time, there are occasional flickers in the game. This is mostly due
        to
        having to constantly update the boids, redraw the screen, and poll the ADC values at a very high frequency so
        that
        it appears everything is happening concurrently. However, this flickering was improved when work was divided
        between
        the two cores.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
        The design of this project aligned very well with our expectations. We expected to model the game from the show
        Severance and the result turned out to be very similar to the game in the show.
    </p>
    <p>
        What could have been done in another approach, in order to improve accuracy, was display things such as the logo
        using a bitmap. This could be achieved by downloading the Lumon logo online and turning it into a bitmap image,
        loading it onto the RP2040’s memory, and displaying it on the VGA. This would have better mirrored what is on
        the
        show.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another thing we could have implemented was music. Although there were attempts, the background music could not
        have
        been found online to download. Additionally, the background music lasted too long such that once this audio was
        converted to an array of unsigned 16 bit integers, there would have been too much memory overhead that other
        parts
        of the program would suffer.
    </p>
    <p>
        While we did not reuse any code or directly copy protected material, our design was inspired by the sorting
        process
        depicted in the TV show Severance. As such, all intellectual property rights related to the original concept and
        design elements remain with the creators and rights holders of Severance. All patented or trademark issues are
        non-existent as long as we don’t present this project as an original creation or try to monetize this game in
        any
        manner. Therefore, a patent opportunity is not an option.
    </p>
    <p>
        In conclusion, this project provided a chance to use what we learned throughout the semester such that we were
        able
        to replicate a game from a popular TV show using a Raspberry Pi 2040. This project emphasizes the versatility
        and
        potential of a microcontroller. To create a game that we see on television while only using a microcontroller
        shows
        how the use of a microcontroller is dependent on one’s imagination.
